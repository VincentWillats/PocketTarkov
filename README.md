4. Hotkey can be changed in Settings.
5. (Optional) Create your own copy of the quest item tracker google sheet from [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FZMjvxB0RM89Nf7o7nNIWYf78ahp8-0q4nV6CrP-Kw8/edit?usp=sharing)

This application simply sits over the top of Escape From Tarkov and displays web links for your convience.
It pulls the tarkov window position and size from the windows API and does not interact with the cilent at all.
