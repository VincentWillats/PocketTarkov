## Features
- Display Maps
- Display Ammo Ballistics
- Display Tasks


## How To Use
1. Open Escape From Tarkov in Borderless or Windowed.
2. Run PocketTarkov.exe.
3. Open and close the Overlay with Left Shift & C, or double click taskbar notification icon.
4. Hotkey can be changed in Settings.

## Future Plans
- Add scroll zoom on maps.

- Add Opacity options to windows.

## How It Works
This application simply sits over the top of Escape From Tarkov and displays web links for your convience.
It pulls the tarkov window position and size from the windows API and does not interact with the cilent at all.
