## Features

## How To Use
1. Open Escape From Tarkov in Borderless or Windowed.
2. Run PocketTarkov.exe.
3. Open and close the Overlay with Left Shift & V, or double click taskbar notification icon.
4. Hotkey can be changed in Settings.
5. (Optional) Create your own copy of the quest item tracker google sheet from [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FZMjvxB0RM89Nf7o7nNIWYf78ahp8-0q4nV6CrP-Kw8/edit?usp=sharing)
6. (Optional) Add your google sheet URL to the settings.

## Future Plans
- Built in quest and item tracker.

## How It Works
This application simply sits over the top of Escape From Tarkov and displays web links for your convience.
It pulls the tarkov window position and size from the windows API and does not interact with the cilent at all.
The market prices are pulled using https://tarkov-market.com/ API, so special thanks to Tarkov Market!
